                Recently we've announced some changes to the technology we
                provide and more importantly the exciting shift to the more
                streamlined experience that is

            <p>
                UPDATE: My opinion on web-based experiences remains confused.
                While the core technology appears extremely promising, consumer
                behaviour remains quite biased towards the app ecosystem.
            </p>

            <p>
                We're entirely serious about bringing real virtual people to
                life. The place where characters live is extremely important. It
                must be easily accessible, no restrictions, sustainable long
                term, and relatively future-proof. We have concluded that the
                place these characters will live is unlikely to be within
                private Python projects on the edge, within isolated Unity
                projectsâ€¦ or even completely within a mobile app.
            </p>

            <h2>Easily Accessible</h2>
            <p>
                The open web is honestly a miracle. The fact that I can go into
                my grandmother's home, fire up a big old beige PC and access a
                website made yesterday is mind-blowing. What's more mind-blowing
                is that I can open up that very same website on a brand new
                iPhone 14 Pro max and send messages and content to the old beige
                paperweight despite them being 20 years apart in age. Web allows
                anyone to talk to a Carter character on any device, or in any
                browser - including an in-app browser like TikTok's, a Raspberry
                Pi, a custom Electron desktop app etc.
            </p>

            <h2>Restrictions</h2>
            <p>
                Apps are amazing, but they're extremely slow to maintain,
                restricted by large corporations and by individual device
                capabilities. This is especially hard when trying to use a
                microphone, camera etc. And then, if you want to take that app
                and run it on a Raspberry Pi or a PC you almost always end up
                re-writing something from scratch. Web apps can roll out changes
                much faster and without unnecessary scrutiny. Building a plugin
                mechanism within an iOS app, for example, would be much too
                restrictive for what we have planned for Carter. The open web
                also allows us to simulate any character, conversation, or
                relationship we want.
            </p>

            <h2>Exposure</h2>
            <p>
                Character creators and plugin creators have been making some
                truly incredible things, with no good way to share them among
                other Carter usersâ€¦let alone their friends! We've literally been
                asking non-developers to â€˜pip install' in order to speak to a
                character. This makes no sense. By creating one, standardized
                place that works across all devices we can open up much more
                opportunity for the community to get the exposure they deserve
                for the things they make and benefit from it in many ways - some
                are still under wraps.
            </p>

            <h2>Future Proof</h2>
            <p>
                This is the big one. The browser in recent years has gained a
                lot of horsepower due to incredible new web standards. We're
                seeing game engines, ML on the edge and more due to this.
                WebGPU, for example, is becoming supported across many devices.
                It allows websites to better access the hardware they're running
                on, specifically the GPU. Great for gaming in the browserâ€¦but
                also great for building truly revolutionary AI-powered
                experiences. WebXR gives websites the ability to run augmented
                and virtual reality content - on a phone it's a little
                awkwardâ€¦but on a Quest 3 or an Apple Vision Pro this could
                really change how we think about the web and the virtual people
                that live there.
            </p>

            <h2>Intriguing Potential Future Side-quests</h2>
            <p>
                Did you know that VSCode, Discord, Spotify, and Slack are all
                actually just downloadable browsers that run one web app?
                Electron and other technologies have started pulling web tech
                off the web and onto the local OS. Who knows what could mean
                down the line with a desktop
                <a
                    href="https://carter.chat?utm_source=huwprosser.github.io&utm_medium=blog"

                >
                and enhanced hardware connectivity. The developer ecosystem
                around web is weird, wacky, and powerful, it will lead to great
                things for Carter.
            </p>

            <p>
                We're building a place where creators can bring characters to
                life, customize and enhance them with plugins and share them
                with non-developers on any device. On top of that, every
                character will have first-class text and voice capabilities that
                run on any device - deeper emotions, much better memory and a
                few other things we're not quite ready to announce yet.
            </p>

            <p>
                We have tonnes more to talk about but I wanted to keep this
                first post concise and technically oriented to specifically
                share with the developer community.
