            I've been putting things on the internet for a long time. I've used
            some amazing sites - bio.link and substack as well as discord and of
            course tiktok. The thing is...sometime you just need a place that
            you call home. Something that loads fast, doesn't spam people and
            gets the point across with no bullshit. that's what this is.
