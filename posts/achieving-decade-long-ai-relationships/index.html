                Humanity has only had AI systems that can string together
                coherent sentences for 18 months, we're still super early. From
                our journey so far at Carter Labs we've noticed a tonne of
                things I believe are paramount to realistic and compelling
                interactions with AI characters. While there's a tonne of work
                to do, A truly realistic and valuable, long-term relationship
                with AI is possible with no further moon-shot breakthroughs in
                underlying technology. Instead, we must focus on opinionated
                design principles grounded on common sense observations about
                how human ‚Äî> human relationships work.

                <strong>Emotional Intelligence.</strong> Humanity has a powerful
                new ally when it comes to productivity. GPTs are extremely good
                at high-IQ tasks. They've become a
                jack-of-all-trades-master-of-all-trades. The one thing they lack
                is emotional intelligence. It is extremely important that these
                systems understand the ramifications of how they talk about
                things, when not to use long responses, what not to say and when
                to bring up sensitive subjects. So far these models are not very
                good at this, but they will need to be if they are to become
                more than tools.

                <strong>Imperfections.</strong> I'm a huge Stan Lee fan - Stan
                Lee's Marvel characters are popular because they are imperfect.
                Tony Stark was an alcoholic narcissist, Spiderman was insecure,
                Black widow has a dark past‚Ä¶ After simulating thousands of AI
                characters on
                <a href="https://carter.chat" target="_blank">carter.chat</a>
                and planning to simulate millions more, we can see that
                imperfection often directly transfers to engagement. Talking
                style, insecurity‚Ä¶even getting facts wrong, can be extremely
                endearing to the user. One caveat, you cannot artificially
                create imperfections, the AI must develop them, remember them
                and be able to resolve them itself. The balance between
                imperfections being endearing and annoying is a fine line.

                <strong>Time.</strong> Time is hugely important to humans. The
                time of day, the time since you last spoke, how many seconds it
                takes someone to respond‚Ä¶time is something language models
                cannot represent effectively in the way they're being commonly
                used. They may have an understanding of time, especially
                sentence's such as ‚Äútwo hours have passed‚Äù but more nuanced
                time-related context we take for granted when talking among
                humans - most language models struggle to correctly represent
                this, it is so far unclear as to wether this is a problem with
                data or their underlying architecture...I suspect the former.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Context.</strong> Context is everything, Where are you?
                What are you doing? Have you been here before? What's the vibe
                of the situation (fast-paced, slow, quiet, happy, sad)?. While
                AI does seem to be making it's way towards an understanding of
                these things it still has a long way to go and may need our
                help. A good example is the enormous challenge we had in early
                2023 trying to get our AI characters to respond in shorter
                sentences during moments of intense gameplay and long paragraphs
                in slower-paced scenes.

            <p>
                <strong>Changing Opinion.</strong> Humans are extremely
                stubborn. ChatGPT is not. Humans change their minds and can be
                slowly convinced of things, language models can't do this in the
                same way. They're either too easily persuaded or too stubborn.
                This is due to how they hold information and how they recall it.
                Out-of-the-box models like GPT4 are designed to be as helpful as
                possible, which means they've learned to agree instead of engage
                in conflict. When it comes to simulating relationships, no
                matter the type, we must embrace conflicting opinions - they are
                what make us unique.
            </p>

                <strong>Reflection.</strong> Every night, thousands of
                Carter.chat characters dream. They reflect on everything they
                know and evolve based on that. This is just a version 0 of a
                larger concept we know our human brains are doing. Humans are
                exceptionally good at reflection, relating different thoughts
                and developing assumptions on incomplete information (sometimes
                to our detriment).
            </p>

            <p>
                This was not an exhaustive list, there are many different
                challenges in memory alone but we're actively working on all of
                these, some we are already on the way to resolving, others may
                require a much deeper understanding of psychology to truly
                simulate. If AI characters achieve all of these things they will
                be the most engaging, retaining and entertaining technology ever
                created. We expect AI relationships of all kinds to stretch
                decades.
