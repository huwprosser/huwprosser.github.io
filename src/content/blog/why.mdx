I've been building things with AI since 2008, when I first saw J.A.R.V.I.S in Iron Man. The idea of having an AI assistant that could help with everyday tasks was fascinating to me. I started by learning Python and building simple chatbots, and over the years, I've worked on various AI projects.

## Building in Public

One of the most rewarding aspects of my journey has been sharing my work with others. When I started posting about my J.A.R.V.I.S project on TikTok in 2020, I was amazed by the response. People were genuinely interested in the process and wanted to learn more about AI.

## Sharing Knowledge

That's why I decided to start this blog. I want to share my experiences, learnings, and insights with others who are interested in AI. Whether you're just starting out or you're an experienced developer, I hope you'll find something useful here.

## What's Next?

I'll be posting regularly about:

-   My ongoing J.A.R.V.I.S project
-   AI development tips and tricks
-   Thoughts on the future of AI
-   Behind-the-scenes looks at Carter Labs

Stay tuned!
