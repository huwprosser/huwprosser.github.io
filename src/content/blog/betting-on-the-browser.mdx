At Carter Labs, we've made a strategic decision to focus on browser-based AI experiences. Here's why we believe the browser is the future of AI applications.

## The Power of the Web

The web browser has evolved from a simple document viewer to a powerful application platform. Modern browsers support:

-   WebGL for 3D graphics
-   WebAssembly for near-native performance
-   WebRTC for real-time communication
-   Web Workers for parallel processing
-   WebGPU for hardware acceleration

## Accessibility First

Browser-based applications offer unparalleled accessibility:

1. **No Installation Required**: Users can start immediately
2. **Cross-Platform**: Works on any device with a browser
3. **Instant Updates**: No need to download and install updates
4. **Lower Barrier to Entry**: Familiar interface for users

## AI in the Browser

Recent advancements have made it possible to run sophisticated AI models directly in the browser:

-   **TensorFlow.js** and similar libraries for model inference
-   **WebGPU** for hardware-accelerated computation
-   **WebAssembly** for efficient model execution
-   **Streaming** capabilities for real-time AI interactions

## Our Approach

At Carter Labs, we're leveraging these technologies to create immersive AI experiences:

-   Real-time character interactions
-   Browser-based voice processing
-   Efficient model serving and caching
-   Progressive Web App capabilities

## Looking Forward

The browser platform continues to evolve, and we're excited about upcoming technologies:

-   WebGPU adoption and optimization
-   New WebAssembly features
-   Improved mobile capabilities
-   Enhanced privacy features

We believe that betting on the browser is not just about technologyâ€”it's about making AI accessible to everyone, everywhere.
