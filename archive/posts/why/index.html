            <h2>Why have I done this?</h2>
            I've been putting things on the internet for a long time. I've used
            some amazing sites - bio.link and substack as well as discord and of
            course tiktok. The thing is...sometime you just need a place that
            you call home. Something that loads fast, doesn't spam people and
            gets the point across with no bullshit. that's what this is.

            <h2>How does this work?</h2>
            This website is built in pure HTML and CSS. It's hosted on github
            and uses their github pages feature to serve the site. I've used
            vanilla JavaScript to poll the GitHub API and return a list of all
            the items in the /posts directory. I then use this list to populate
            the posts list on the homepage. There's also a secondary script that
            runs on the post pages themselves which handles the title, back
            button and the date formatting. I wanted to be able to add pages to
            the site with no CMS, from any device, so having this additional
            script allows me to clumsily add new posts without having to worry
            about the formatting.

            <br />
            anyway enough about that, go and use
            <a href="https://carterlabs.ai?utm_source=huwprosser.github.io"
                >carterlabs.ai</a
            >.
